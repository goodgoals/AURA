# AURA
The code repository for the next-gen AI architecture. Not LLMs. Those are just inference engines which hallucinate, wrong many times, we all know the issues. But it’s LLMs to blame, not AI. So this architecture fixes many problems by using an entire different architecture and the source code for that architecture is provided here.
